# First problem

optimization of a quadratic function with GD and Newton's method:
analyzes the optimization of a quadratic function ( f(x) = x_1^2 + bx_2^2 ) using the Gradient Backtracking Method and Newton's Method. The goal is to evaluate the impact of various parameters on the convergence behavior of these methods.
# Second Problem

implement the Cholesky factorization algorithm from scratch, solve a given linear system using the factorization, and compare the results with numpy's implementation using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
